      <description>We have just released GoCV (https://gocv.io) version 0.14.0, our Go programming language package for computer vision using OpenCV. Thanks to the efforts of our contributors and team this is one of our most significant updates yet.
This new GoCV version has been timed to land in parallel with the just shipped OpenCV 3.4.2 release, which features some substantial new functionality for using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for computer vision. The new GoCV also supports the Intel OpenVINO Inference Engine for DNN hardware acceleration on CPU&amp;rsquo;s, GPU&amp;rsquo;s, and VPU&amp;rsquo;s too.</description>

      <description>It is with great pleasure that we release to you our latest GoCV (https://gocv.io) version 0.11.0. This is an important update, because it slightly changes the API from previous versions. By this we mean breaking changes, which we will explain below.
We of course have lots of new functionality and features, as always largely due to our amazing contributors. Thank you to everyone who has added code, documentation, or feedback to the project in preparation for this release.</description>

      <description>We are pleased to present to you the new GoCV (https://gocv.io) version 0.8.0, which is our first release of 2018. This is a big update and adds a lot of powerful new functionality, along with bug fixes and more documentation, thanks to our wonderful contributors.
The new version adds support for the OpenCV Deep Neural Network (DNN) module, which means you can now use Caffe (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) and Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/) models from your GoCV code.</description>

      <title>Putting Eyes on the IoT - The Video</title>

      <description>The video from &amp;ldquo;Putting Eyes on the IoT: Advanced Computer Vision Using Golang&amp;rdquo;, the talk about GoCV during the Intel Global IoT Devfest, has just been posted online.
Check it at at:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR8T8rvlNuk
Even if you are a newcomer to Go programming or computer vision, the talk is intended so you can get something useful out of it.
Also, provides useful information about not just OpenCV but also the Intel Computer Vision SDK, which has not had a lot of tutorial content yet overall, let along in Golang.</description>

      <description>Perhaps you have been wondering &amp;ldquo;where is the blog for this project?&amp;rdquo;. Well, wonder no more, here it is!
We have a Twitter account too We also now have an &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; Twitter account at @GoCVio please follow us.
What we will cover Updates to GoCV or to OpenCV itself, cool things built with GoCV, events we attend, and the like.
We want to hear from you! Are you using GoCV for something?</description>

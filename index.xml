      <description>This example opens a video capture device using device &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo;, reads frames, and shows the video in a GUI window:
package main import ( &amp;quot;gocv.io/x/gocv&amp;quot; ) func main() { webcam, _ := gocv.VideoCaptureDevice(0) window := gocv.NewWindow(&amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot;) img := gocv.NewMat() for { webcam.Read(&amp;amp;img) window.IMShow(img) window.WaitKey(1) } }  </description>

      <description>This page has information on how to install and use GoCV on Ubuntu, as well as other Linux distros.
You can use make to install OpenCV 3.4.2 with the handy Makefile included with this repo. If you already have installed OpenCV, you do not need to do so again. The installation performed by the Makefile is minimal, so it may remove OpenCV options such as Python or Java wrappers if you have already installed OpenCV some other way.</description>

      <description>It is with great pleasure that we release to you our latest GoCV (https://gocv.io) version 0.11.0 This is an important update, because it slightly changes the API from previous versions. By this we mean breaking changes, which we will explain below.
We of course have lots of new functionality and features, as always largely due to our amazing contributors. Thank you to everyone who has added code, documentation, or feedback to the project in preparation for this release.</description>

      <description>This page has information on how to install and use GoCV on macOS.
Installing Install the GoCV package:
go get -u -d gocv.io/x/gocv  Now, install OpenCV 3.4.2 using Homebrew:
brew install opencv  Note that if you already have an earlier version of OpenCV installed, you should upgrade it to the latest version, instead of installing:
brew upgrade opencv  You can avoid many problems with GoCV on macOS just by making sure that you do not have multiple versions of OpenCV installed, and are using the latest version.</description>

      <title>Face Detect</title>

      <description>This is a more complete example that opens a video capture device using device &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo;. It also uses the CascadeClassifier class to load an external data file containing the classifier data. The program grabs each frame from the video, then uses the classifier to detect faces. If any faces are found, it draws a green rectangle around each one, then displays the video in an output window:
package main import ( &amp;quot;fmt&amp;quot; &amp;quot;image&amp;quot; &amp;quot;image/color&amp;quot; &amp;quot;os&amp;quot; &amp;quot;strconv&amp;quot; &amp;quot;gocv.</description>

      <description>We are pleased to present to you the new GoCV (https://gocv.io) version 0.8.0, which is our first release of 2018. This is a big update and adds a lot of powerful new functionality, along with bug fixes and more documentation, thanks to our wonderful contributors.
The new version adds support for the OpenCV Deep Neural Network (DNN) module, which means you can now use Caffe (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) and Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/) models from your GoCV code.</description>

      <description>This page has information on how to install and use GoCV on Microsoft Windows 10, 64-bit.
Installing Install the GoCV package:
go get -u -d gocv.io/x/gocv  In order to use GoCV on Windows you must build and install OpenCV 3.4.2. First download and install MinGW-W64 and CMake, as follows.
MinGW-W64 Download and run the MinGW-W64 compiler installer from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/?source=typ_redirect.
The latest version of the MinGW-W64 toolchain is 7.3.0, but any version from 7.</description>

      <description>The video from &amp;ldquo;Putting Eyes on the IoT: Advanced Computer Vision Using Golang&amp;rdquo;, the talk about GoCV during the Intel Global IoT Devfest, has just been posted online.
Check it at at:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR8T8rvlNuk
Even if you are a newcomer to Go programming or computer vision, the talk is intended so you can get something useful out of it.
Also, provides useful information about not just OpenCV but also the Intel Computer Vision SDK, which has not had a lot of tutorial content yet overall, let along in Golang.</description>

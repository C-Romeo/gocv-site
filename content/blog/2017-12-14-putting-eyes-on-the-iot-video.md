The video from the talk about GoCV during the Intel Global IoT Devfest has just been posted online.

Check it at at:

Even if you are a newcomer to Go programming or computer vision, the talk is intended so you can get something useful out of it.

Also, provides useful information about not just OpenCV but also the Intel Computer Vision SDK, which has not had a lot of tutorial content yet overall, let along in Golang.

Last big point: in the talk, we solve the 3 most common problems in computer vision, each of them in less than 90 lines of Go code, complete with demos.

Hope you enjoy it and find it useful.

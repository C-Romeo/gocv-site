# Welcome to GoCV

[![GoCV](images/gocvlogo.jpg)](http://gocv.io/)

The GoCV package provides Go language bindings for the [OpenCV 3](http://opencv.org/) computer vision library.

GoCV supports the latest release of OpenCV (v3.3) on Linux, OS X, and (soon) Windows. We hope to make the Go programming language a "first-class" client compatible with the latest developments in the OpenCV ecosystem.

GoCV also supports the [Intel Computer Vision SDK](https://software.intel.com/en-us/cvsdk-devguide) using the Photography Vision Library (PVL).

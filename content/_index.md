[![GoCV](images/gocvlogo.jpg)](https://gocv.io/)

GoCV gives programmers who use the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/) access to the [OpenCV 3 computer vision library](http://opencv.org/).

The GoCV package supports the latest releases of Go and OpenCV v3.4.2 on Linux, macOS, and Windows. We intend to make the Go language a "first-class" client compatible with the latest developments in the OpenCV ecosystem.

GoCV also supports the [Intel OpenVINO](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) toolkit.

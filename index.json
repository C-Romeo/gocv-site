If you already have installed OpenCV, you do not need to do so again. The installation performed by the Makefile is minimal, so it may remove OpenCV options such as Python or Java wrappers if you have already installed OpenCV some other way.\nInstalling Install the GoCV package:\n go get github.com/hybridgroup/gocv  Change directories into the newly installed package directory:\n cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hybridgroup/gocv  Now you can run the needed installation steps listed below.\nInstall required packages First, you need to update the system, and install any required packages:\n make deps  Download source Next, download the OpenCV 3.3 and OpenCV Contrib source code:\n make download  Build Build and install everything. This will take quite a while:\n make build  Cleanup extra files After the installation is complete, you can remove the extra files and folders:\n make cleanup  How to build/run code In order to build/run Go code that uses this package, you will need to specify the location for the include and lib files in your GoCV installation.\nOne time per session, you must run the script:\n source ./env.sh  Now you should be able to build or run any of the examples:\n go run ./cmd/version/main.go  The version program should output the following:\n gocv version: 0.1.0 opencv lib version: 3.3.0  "

We hope to make the Go programming language a \u0026ldquo;first-class\u0026rdquo; client compatible with the latest developments in the OpenCV ecosystem.\nGoCV also supports the Intel Computer Vision SDK using the Photography Vision Library (PVL).\nJust looking for the code?
